## List of Projects and Github repositories:

1. Neural networks over U.N. World Happiness Data
2. Image Classification
3. [Text Classification using neural networks](https://github.com/bavilaa/adv_ml/blob/master/BBC_News_Category_Classification_Mini_Hackathon.ipynb)

  In this project, using a small dataset with news articles from BBC, articles are classified using neural networks and an embedding approach. Contains, sequentional neural networks, convulational networks, stacked networks and some variants using bidirectional embedding and dropout.


4. Leontief Macroeconomic Equilibrium

   With this simple equation ![P = X 1_n + y](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P%20%3D%20X%201_n%20%2B%20y) it's possible to know the new macroeconomic equilibrium given a shock, for example, What happens to the GDP if total spent on restaurants falls a 20%?
5. [Don Quixote Text Analysis](https://github.com/bavilaa/quijote)

	Don Quixote of la Mancha is the most famous book in Spanish speakers and one of the most read in human history. In this project, I want to make his fame bigger and in the process make some basic natural language processing. The final goal is to create a sentiment indicator and classify the chapters into categories.
