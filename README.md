## List of Projects and Github repositories:

1. [ World Happiness Prediction](https://github.com/bavilaa/adv_ml/blob/master/Assignment1_f.ipynb)

    This data set contains a list of countries and a set of features like:GDP per capita,Social Support, Healthy life expectancy. Using macine learning algorithms the goal is to find a model that predicts the happiness level of a country using these features. What are the most important variables which determine the happiness level?

2. [Image Classification using a tumor dataset](https://github.com/bavilaa/adv_ml/blob/master/Tumor_Classification.ipynb)


   In this project, a list of brain images with tumors are automatically classified using machine learning algorithms. First, the images are transformed into number matrixes or three dimensions arrays (RGB), and next supervised classification algorithms are applied.

3. [Text Classification using neural networks](https://github.com/bavilaa/adv_ml/blob/master/BBC_News_Classification.ipynb)

  A dataset with news articles (BBC) from 5 categories (sport, business, politics, tech, and entertainment) are automatically classified using neural networks : sequentional, convlational and stacked with some variants using bidirectional embedding and dropout.


4. [Leontief Macroeconomic Equilibrium](https://github.com/bavilaa/leontief)

 
   If the families total spent on restaurants (or any other industry) falls 20%, what happens with the rest of the economy?. Using this simple equation ![P = X 1_n + y](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P%20%3D%20X%201_n%20%2B%20y) it's possible to know the new macroeconomic equilibrium given a shock and answer this kind of questions.

5. [Don Quixote Text Analysis](https://github.com/bavilaa/quijote)

  Don Quixote of la Mancha is the most famous book in Spanish speakers and one of the most read in human history. In this project, I want to make his fame bigger and in the process make some basic natural language processing. The final goal is to create a sentiment indicator and classify the chapters into categories.
